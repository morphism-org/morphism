# @morphism

Functional programming monorepo aimed at improving the developer 
experience around `fp-ts` and associated libraries.

<br/>


### @morphism/fp

A faithful re-export of `fp-ts` that uses declaration merging to 
allow access to both a type _and_ all methods on that type,
and with only a single import.

For more information and examples, checkout that project's [readme](https://github.com/morphism-org/morphism/tree/master/packages/fp).

<br/>

### @morphism/runtime

A combination of `io-ts` and `io-ts-types`, exported under 
the `Runtime` namespace, that acts as an all-in-one input/output
validation library.

For more information and examples, checkout that project's [readme](https://github.com/morphism-org/morphism/tree/master/packages/runtime).

<br/>

### @morphism/utils

A re-export of `fp-ts-contrib` with some additional convenience functions/domains.

For more information and examples, checkout that project's [readme](https://github.com/morphism-org/morphism/tree/master/packages/utils).
